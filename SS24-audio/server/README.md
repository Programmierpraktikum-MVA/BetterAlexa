# main.py

This script is used to start a FastAPI server that handles audio transcription requests.

## Setup

1. **Virtual Environment**: It is recommended to create a virtual environment for running this script. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    This creates a new virtual environment in a directory named `.venv` and activates it. Preferably do this in the server directory.

2. **Install Requirements**: Install the required Python packages. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal in the server directory.

## Usage

Run the script by typing `python main.py` in your terminal. This will start the FastAPI server.
